Description
Birth complications are one of the main causes of perinatal mortality. The fetal cardiotocograph (CTG) can be used as a monitoring tool during labor as it can allow assessment of the baby's health status during birth.

Cardiotocography simultaneously records fetal heart rate, fetal movements and uterine contractions. The recording allows the healthcare professional to assess the fetal heartbeat during late gestation and the baby's response to contractions throughout labor until birth.

In this regard, data were collected from 2,126 fetal cardiotocograms (CTGs) and the respective diagnostic features were measured. The CTGs were also classified by three expert obstetricians and a consensus classification label was assigned to each CTG. In this way the diagnostic characteristics represent the set of explanatory variables that will allow estimating the fetal status (target) as normal or abnormal. 

Both in the sprints and in the project, you should strive to adjust the best possible algorithm. Once the algorithm has been obtained, you must submit a document of a maximum of 3 pages containing the following sections:

Descriptive analysis of the explanatory variables and the target.
Detail of the division of the data set into training and test sets.
Selected algorithm together with the hyperparameters chosen in the modeling.
ROC curve, Area Under the Curve, confusion matrix and accuracy of the algorithm for the training and test sets.
In addition, you must attach the final notebook with the developed code.
